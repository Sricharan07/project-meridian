# OpenAM Laser powder bed fusion system
<p align="center"><img src="misc/git/DTU_Logo.png" height="100" alt="DTU logo" /></p>

_Update October 2024_
This repo contains the documentation for the second iteration of the metal laser powder bed fusion system. Version 1 and 2 overlap to a significant degree, however, key differences make version 2 the successor and ostensibly replace version 1.
The following repo deals mostly with the hardware of the system. See the other repos owned by DTUOpenAM for the firmware and software required to run the system.

For an in-depth description of the approach to designing the system, please see the publication based on version 1: [Applying systems engineering principles to develop an open source laser based metal powder bed fusion system](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/RPJ-12-2023-0422/full/html).

## Project Impetus 
The world of Laser Powder-bed Fusion (L-PBF) has been tightly held within the clutches of proprietary practices, limiting innovation and knowledge sharing. This project was born out of a desire to challenge this exclusivity by creating an open-source infrastructure for L-PBF. The aim was to democratize access to this advanced manufacturing process, stimulate innovation, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. Despite the complex and professional nature of L-PBF, which involves dealing with high-power lasers, explosive metal powders, and specialized equipment, the project's commitment to open-source principles remained unwavering.

## Project Results
The project successfully designed, built, verified, and validated an open-source metal L-PBF system. The resulting machine is user-friendly, fully open, and performs comparably with commercial L-PBF systems. The entire design and detailed documentation are published under the CERN-OHL-P (permissive) v2 Open Source Hardware license and are accessible for public adaptation and improvement. The project contributes to a broader understanding and accessibility of additive manufacturing technology, paving the way for future enhancements and a community-driven approach to innovation.

## Main system aspects
The various elements will be discussed below in differing levels of detail. A key design goal was to attempt the design of a cost-effective system, rather than the ultimate system. What makes the system good enough for part manufacturing, for research, and for experimenting and developing the process? What design choice lowers the barrier to adoption? And will these choices enable entities with limited funds to utilize the benefits of metal LPBF? These were some of the research goals. The system cost is seen below, which we believe will help the adoption and demystification of metal LPBF.

### Safety

Thorough consideration is needed before working with metal L-PBF, whether you buy or build. This system is an experimental setup meant for R&D, and a certified official has not approved its safety aspects. Proceed with caution at your own risk.

**Safety Sub-System:** The safety sub-system controls the activation of motors and lasers, ensuring they operate only under safe conditions. This includes emergency stops (E-stops) that physically break the connection using a safety contactor, disabling the laser trigger signal, and the motor drivers.

**Interlock Switches:** Interlock switches on the enclosure doors ensure the system is fully sealed before the laser can be activated. The laser can only fire when the doors are closed, no E-stops are pressed, the Reset E-stop button is triggered, and the Activate laser button is enabled.

**Safety Programmable Logic Controller (PLC):** The system employs an ABB Pluto D20 safety PLC as its "brain." This, along with Adam and Eva units from the EDEN series from ABB to monitor the doors and a Smile 41 button interface for emergency stop and reset controls, constitutes the core of the safety system.

European Union Directives: In the EU, the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC is relevant for ensuring safety in machinery like the L-PBF system. It provides the regulatory basis for the harmonization of the essential health and safety requirements for machinery at the EU level.

OSHA Directives: In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has regulations that would apply to the operation of a laser-based system. This includes standards for personal protective equipment (29 CFR 1910.132), general requirements for all machines (29 CFR 1910.212), and specific regulations for welding, cutting, and brazing (29 CFR 1910.252).

The open-source Laser Powder Bed Fusion system incorporates a comprehensive safety subsystem, including emergency stops, interlock switches, and a safety PLC to ensure safe operation. Compliance with relevant EU directives and OSHA regulations is crucial for the lawful and safe operation of such advanced manufacturing systems​​. Recreation of the system should be done by carefully considering local rules and regulations while employing common sense. Please seek professional guidance when in doubt regarding safety systems and their design. Consider contacting services or safety providers such as (but not limited to) Pilz, ABB, Pheonix Contacts, Jokab Safety, etc.


## The Project and Git Structure

The open-source Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) project embodies core Systems Engineering principles to enhance its design and functionality, significantly benefiting the research and manufacturing communities. By employing a structured approach, the project manages complexities and fosters adaptability, which is crucial for evolving user requirements and technology.

**Systems Engineering Principles:**
Iterative Design Process: Adhering to an iterative design process, the project transitions from general concepts to detailed designs, ensuring a comprehensive development lifecycle. It employs the Vee model, which guides concept exploration, requirements definition, and system validation, ensuring a robust and reliable open-source system.

Modularity and Open Control: The project employs modularity, where system elements perform specific functions. This approach enhances adaptability, allowing easy upgrades, maintenance, and repairs. It also integrates black-box components with robust control protocols, reducing complexity and ensuring system flexibility.

### Vee-model: 
This provided a structured framework for the project's lifecycle, guiding it from concept exploration through to system validation.

### Relational Database Method: 
Instead of using Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which was considered, a relational database method was employed to manage information about every facet of every element in the system. Airtable was used, which will also be shared. This will function as the Bill of Materials. A link to the main view is provided. Please contact if you wish to be granted more access to the Airtable BOM.


## Physical and Digital

The repo deals with the physical aspects, whereas the controller repo and the post-processer repo deal with the digital aspects. The controller is very much still under development, and a major redesign is underway. However, with certain limitations, the controller is very capable. And if considering the pricepoint of the Teensy 4.1-based constroller it is unbeatable.
